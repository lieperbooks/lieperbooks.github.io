                The book community does not have a singular place to grow and flourish online. A<br />
                huge portion of this is to be blamed on the new age online portals that just swooped in and displaced
                the bookstores disturbing the independent literary circles and the<br />
                whole ecosystem of bookstores which was hurried and could not adapt to the sudden change.<br />

            </div>
            <div class="content hidden m0 py">
                We answer this change. Books are important, books are a form of meaningful<br />
                interaction in a way the online retailers can never understand, we celebrate them<br />
                and to do them and the ones who read and write them justice we give the power<br />
                back to the people in the community.<br />
